version 7	6 Feb 1998
	added code to make -skipcount work

version 6	16 Jan 1998
	COPYRIGHT included as separate file in distribution
	updated -contact information

version 5	10 Jan 1998
	added -contact and -copyright options
	fixed bug in -flushcount and -stat-interval
	 (they were totally inoperative!)
	d4_invinfcache: new function to fix problem with
	 invalidation and CCC calculations
	 (the fully assoc & infinite caches weren't invalidated)
	fixed problem with CCC calculations and sub-blocks
	 (infinite cache didn't report enough block misses
	  and didn't handle multi-subblock references)
	fixed problem with multi-subblock references
	 (misses were not recognized if some sub-blocks hit)
	fixed stats output problem for demand block misses
	 and prefetch misses
	d4cache structure: added multiblock field
	 to count multiblock refs
	added output count of multi-block references
	fixed pixie32fmt.c, pixie64fmt.c, testing/p2b.c, and testing/p2d.c
	 to handle SWR/SWL properly (they were producing
	 bogus multi-block references)
	d4_splitm(): new function to handle multi-block references
	d4ref(): always check for D4F_RO violation now
	 call d4_splitm to handle multi-block references
	verify_options(): check D4_BITMAP_RSIZE
	xdinfmt.c: include <string.h>, better error messages
	extended din input format is now the default

version 4	8 Dec 1997
	new copyright notice
	main(): do not copy-back icache at end of run or -flushcount.
	 (This avoids a surprising double copy-back in level 2 caches.)
	Added D4F_RO flag for read-only caches.
	changes to stack organization:
		stacks are now always circular & doubly linked
		new structure, d4stackhead, introduced to point at top of stack
		d4stacknode fields lru/mru replace with down/up
		each stack always has exactly a+1 nodes, where a=associativity
		d4makenode(), d4push(), d4_putonfreelist(),
		 d4_trimstack(): eliminated
		d4hash(): new function
		d4movetotop(), d4movetobot(), d4unhash(), d4_find,
		 d4findnth(): re-engineered
		d4setup(): stack initialization changed accordingly
	replacement policy function args simplified
	replacement policy functions are always called now
	 (previously they were not called for hit at top of stack; this
	 change allows various arbitrary non-stack-oriented policy functions.)
	d4_wbline() changed to d4_wbblock()
	d4_invline() changed to d4_invblock(), args changed
	d4rep_lru(), d4rep_fifo(), d4rep_random(): tuned for better speed
	d4ref(): tuned for better speed, new d4_find usage
	xdinfmt.c: new file, extended din input format
	tracein.c, tracein.h, Makefile.in: support for -informat D, xdin format
	cmdmain.c: improvements to -dineroIII help
	d4.1: documentation for new extended din format, other minor cleanups
	ref.c: check for multi-block references
	testing/Makefile, testing/mm.??: pixie sample input files are
	 no longer kept in uuencoded format
	testing/p2d.c: added -4 option to generate extended din format
	testing/testscript:
		complain if programs or files not found
		automatically decide when to run p2d -4

version 3	17 Nov 1997
	Most options now have default values.
	More verbose output for usage errors.
	Option -dineroIII added.
	size field of d4memref changed from unsigned char to unsigned short.
	Binary input format changed from 6 bytes to 8 bytes.
	
version 2	10 Nov 1997
	More testing, a few bug fixes, man pages added.

version 1	2 Sept 1997
	Initial version.
